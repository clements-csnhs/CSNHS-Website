					<h1>This year's project</h1>
					<div>
						Our goal this year is to help expand the impact of the Computer Science National Honor Society by making access to our assistance and services more easily available to all. To do this, we plan to create a web-based service that will allow organizations throughout our community to request assistance so that our members can volunteer to help. In doing so, we hope to be better able to help our community and allow a greater number of people to recieve our help.
